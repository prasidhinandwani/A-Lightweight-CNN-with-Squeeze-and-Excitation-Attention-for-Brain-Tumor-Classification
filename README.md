# A Lightweight CNN with Squeeze and Excitation Attention for Brain Tumor Classification

Brain tumors are aberrant cell growths that impair the brains ability to function normally. Being one among the deadliest diseases, prompt and precise detection of brain tumors is crucial for efficient treatment. Although magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) plays a vital role in diagnosis, traditional MRI-based evaluation remains exhausting, work-intensive, and susceptible to misjudgment. In this study, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) enhanced with a Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) attention mechanism is proposed to improve brain tumor classification through deep learning. By adaptively recalibrating feature channel importance, the SE attention component empowers the model to concentrate on tumor-specific patterns, thereby reducing false positives and false negatives equated to conventional CNNs that treat all feature channels equally. Rigorous evaluation was performed using 5-fold cross-validation, ensuring robust and generalizable performance. The proposed lightweight model achieved a fast inference time of 4.0 milliseconds per scan, highlighting its suitability for real-time clinical applications. A comprehensive ablation study revealed that while adding Inception modules improved recall, it also increased misclassification rates due to overfitting. In contrast, the CNN combined with SE attention achieved pioneering results, attaining an accuracy of 99.24%, precision of 99.23%, recall of 98.66%, and an F1-score of 98.94%. These performance scores demonstrate that SE attention significantly enhances classification performance by strengthening feature representations and minimizing redundant activations in medical imaging challenges.
